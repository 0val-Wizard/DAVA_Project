# Truth or Myth?

    animal, the higher the GHG emissions per
    kg.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_</u>

2.  **second** belief I am investigating is: <u>The higher the land use
    per kg, the higher the GHG emissions per kg.</u>

Conclusion: Based on data, this conventional belief is <u>true.</u>

Justification:

> alt="A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated with medium confidence" />
>
> <u>**The above diagram is an interactive histogram where the y-axis is
> greenhouse gas emissions per KG and the x-axis are bins in ranges
> about land use change per kg (**kgCO<sub>2</sub>eq per
> kilogram**)**</u>
>
> <u>**W are able to spit that from the first bin to the fourth bin, as
> land use change per kg increased, so did the greenhouse gas emissions
> per KG. However, the from the 4<sup>th</sup> bin to the 5<sup>th</sup>
> bin, greenhouse gas emissions per KG dropped drastically, from 59.6 to
> 24.5** kgCO<sub>2</sub>eq per kilogram. However, the 5<sup>th</sup>
> bin GHG gas emission is still larger than the ghg gas emissions for
> the 2th and 3<sup>rd</sup> bin. **This supports the idea that The
> higher the land use per kg, the higher the GHG emissions per kg.**</u>
>
> <img src="media/image7.png" style="width:3.91702in;height:2.54741in"
> alt="A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated" />
>
> <u>**I used Group By node and filtered two columns; Land use change
> and Greenhouse gas Emissions per KG. I set both the columns to
> ascending values. We can see on the left column, as the land use
> change value increased from -2.1** kgCO<sub>2</sub>eq per kilogram to
> 16.3 kgCO<sub>2</sub>eq per kilogram**, the corresponding values of
> the GHG emissions(on the right column) increased from 0.2**
> kgCO<sub>2</sub>eq per kilogram **to 59.6** kgCO<sub>2</sub>eq per
> kilogram**. I realised that spotting a trend was not easy using
> numbers(GroupBy node). Hence, for the sake of Data Visualisation, I
> decided to use a scatter plot.**</u>
>
> <img src="media/image8.png" style="width:4.07878in;height:2.6526in"
> alt="A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated with medium confidence" />
>
> <u>**This is a scatter plot, where the x-axis is where the y-axis is
> Greenhouse Gas Emissions per KG and the x-axis are bins in ranges
> about land use change(**kgCO<sub>2</sub>eq per kilogram**)**</u>
>
> <u>**Using the X-axis from -1.101 to around 1.200, most of the points
> are cluttered in the area. Generally, we are able to see a trend that
> the greater the land use, the higher the GHG emissions per KG. I was
> able to spot 2 outliers, they were really far away from rest of the
> points. One outlier at around 14.200 of land use
> change(**kgCO<sub>2</sub>eq per kilogram) had around 18.1 GHG per KG.
> The outlier at around 16.000**(**kgCO<sub>2</sub>eq per kilogram) and
> that corresponded to around 59.6 GHG emission per KG .</u>

> <img src="media/image8.png" style="width:6.37397in;height:4.14527in"
> alt="A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated with medium confidence" />
>
> <u>**I, hence, decided to draw a best fit line on the scatter plot.
> This helped me to further prove my point that the general trend is
> that of increasing. The belief “**The higher the land use per kg, the
> higher the GHG emissions per kg.” is true.</u>

3.  The **third** belief I am investigating is: <u>For every 1000 kcal
    of energy provided to human, plant-based food has lower GHG
    emissions per 1000kcal than animal-based food.</u>

> Conclusion: Based on data, this conventional belief is <u>true</u>
>
> Justification:
>
> <img src="media/image9.png" style="width:4.91396in;height:3.19576in"
> alt="A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated with medium confidence" />
>
> **<u>I decided to use to conditional box plot, where the. Y axis is
> configured as greenhouse gas emissions and the X axis is configured as
> Broad Cat.</u>**
>
> **<u>The category animal under Broad Cat, has UQR of 12.5 , LQR of
> 5.25, IQR = 7.25, Median of 6.89, Minimum of 3.24, maximum of
> 12.53.</u>**
>
> **<u>Whereas, the category plant under Broad Cat, has UQR of 1.35 ,
> LQR of 0.52, IQR = 0.83, Median of 0.93 ,Minimum of 0.07, maximum of
> 1.43</u>**
>
> **<u>From the summary statistics, I am able to learn that animal have
> a greater GHG emission. This is because, the minimum GHG emissions of
> animals is 3.24. While the maximum GHG emissions of plants is 1.43.
> Additionally, the IQR of animals is 7.25 and the IQR of animals is
> 0.83. This supports the idea that the values of GHG emissions of
> plants are more closer and consistent than the values of GHG emissions
> of animals.</u>**

> <img src="media/image10.png" style="width:4.75625in;height:3.0932in"

>
> **<u>Now that I had found the IQR and Median. I decided to use
> Interactive histogram to find the mean GHG emissions per 1000kcal of
> energy. The binning column is set as Broad Cat and the aggregation
> column is GHG emissions per 1000kcal. Average GHG emissions per
> 1000kcal is 12 kgCO<sub>2</sub>eq whereas, the average GHG emission
> per 1000kcal is 3.37 kgCO<sub>2</sub>eq. Hence, this proves the point

> Land Use change it is defined How much GHG is emitted to produce 1 kg
> of product during the land use change stage. This includes above-
> ground changes in biomass from deforestation, and below ground changes

> the land use change value was 2.81000000000000005 while for animals
> the land use change value was 0.7909090909090909. Since, farming
> animals result in a higher Land use change compared to plants. This
> further explains one of the reasons why for every 100kcal of
> animal-based food is consumed has higher GHG gas emissions than
> plant-based food. I would like to add on that the land where animals
> are being used to farm animals could have previously could have been
> filled with trees and plants which photosynthesis, taking and in

> farming animals and instead of growing crops or letting plants grow,
> there could have been net negative of GHG gas emitted. Instead of
> giving off GHG gas emissions, plants/trees would have taken in carbon
> dioxide which would have converted into oxygen via photosynthesis.
