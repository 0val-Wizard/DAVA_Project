Note:
You can also download the .docx version of my Exploratory Data Analysis for better visualization.


### Document Overview:
The file is your EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Assignment for the Data Visualisation & Analytics module (AY2023/2024 Apr Semester). It investigates three common beliefs related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land use, and food sources using visualisation and statistical methods.

### Final Takeaway:
All three tested beliefs were confirmed by the data:
  **Larger animals → higher emissions per kg.**

  **Higher land use → higher emissions.**

  **Plant-based foods → lower emissions per 1000 kcal than animal-based foods.**

The analysis highlights the environmental impact of animal-based diets, especially from larger animals and high land-use farming practices.
